# Microsoft Hack Night NYC

Super proud of what we built and WON at Microsoft Hack Night NYC this week! 🏆🎶
 We took home Best Use of FriendliAI for our AI-powered Music Recommender App!
Our team — Ramachandra Yerramsetti, Sai Kiran Belana, and I- built an AI-powered music recommender that interprets real human moods like:
“I’m sad but want something uplifting.”
 “Play something calm while I study.”
…and returns real Spotify tracks using GenAI and semantic search.

Our Tech Stack:
🔎 Weaviate for semantic retrieval
🧠 FriendliAI for fast, mood-aware LLM inference
📊 Comet Opik for real-time observability
⚙️ FastAPI + Streamlit to tie it all together

💡 What I Learned :
✅ Vector search is the backbone of modern GenAI apps
With Weaviate, we moved beyond keywords to retrieve based on meaning, enabling smarter, more relevant recommendations. This is essential for enterprise AI from knowledge bases to product search.

✅ LLM Inference = performance bottleneck or superpower
FriendliAI's serverless architecture made it ridiculously easy to integrate LLMs into our app, no infra, no latency headaches. Exactly what enterprise apps need to scale GenAI fast.

✅ Observability is not optional
If you can’t see what your AI is doing, you can’t trust it.
 Opik lets us trace every generation, flag issues, measure latency, and build with confidence. This is MLOps for GenAI.

🙌 Thanks to
Soomin Chun from friendly.ai for fast support and API access!
Abby Morgan — for showing us how to trace and debug LLM outputs like pros 
Adam Chan and Varun Deliwala — for helping us understand vector design

🙌Big love to other builders I met:
 Marlon Fuentes, Daniel Gildenbrand, Meet Patel, Aaditya Champaneri, Karthik Sunkari, Sai Sandeep Mamidala— loved sharing space and ideas with you all!

✨ Hackathons remind me why I build:
 Real problems. Fast ideas. Working demos. Great people.

📩 If you're hiring for roles in AI apps, GenAI, vector search, or MLOps — let’s connect. This is what I love doing.
